# fintech-metrics
Session on Fintech metrics. It also stressed the importance of continuous training as a way of life.

Most of the slides are in Spanish, except the Fintech metrics definitions that are in English. Additionally, most of the bibliography at the end is in English as well.

Thanks to my friend Gopi for his help and review to write this presentation.
